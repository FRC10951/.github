From Saigon South International School in Ho Chi Minh City, Team `10951` Saigon
South Dragons will debut in FIRST® AGE™.

The Programming Team writes, tests, and maintains the code that controls the
robot. They ensure the robot responds correctly to driver input, runs autonomous
routines, and integrates with sensors and vision systems. They also manage
software toolchains for programming simulation.

> There is the [SSIS-FRC-10951](https://github.com/SSIS-FRC-10951) organization, however this is only for coaches. As we begin the preseason, the usefulness of a student organization is nonneglible. When the coaches are hesitant to give the student leads membership to their organization, we agreed it was time to establish this organization.
